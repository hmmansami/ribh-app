description: Start any new chat with full context instantly

## Just say this in a new chat:

```
Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and continue where we left off
```

Or for specific tasks:

```
Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md then [your task]
```

## Examples

- "Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md then fix the WhatsApp integration"
- "Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md then add store authentication"
- "Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and tell me what's next"

## The agent will automatically:

1. ✅ Read your project context
2. ✅ Understand the tech stack
3. ✅ Know what's completed
4. ✅ Know what's in progress
5. ✅ Have all key file locations
6. ✅ Have all commands ready

No more explaining everything again! 🎉
