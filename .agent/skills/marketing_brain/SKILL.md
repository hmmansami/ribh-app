# Marketing Brain Skill (RIBH)

This skill utilizes the Hormozi Grand Slam Offer framework to generate copy that minimizes risk and maximizes perceived value for RIBH users.

## 🧠 Core Frameworks

- **Value Equation**: (Dream Outcome × Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort).
- **Grand Slam Offer**: Avatar + Outcome + Time + Risk Reversal.
- **Pain Point Focus**: Highlight the 70% lost revenue.

## 🚀 Execution Instructions

### 1. Generate Recovery Messages
When generating a message sequence:
1.  **Immediate (5m)**: Empathy + "Did you forget something?"
2.  **Logic (1h)**: Benefit focus + Social proof.
3.  **Urgency (6h)**: "Your cart is expiring".
4.  **Incentive (24h)**: 10% Discount hook (Grand Slam style).

### 2. Create Landing Page Copy
Use the structure:
- **Pain**: "You're losing 70% of your sales."
- **Dream**: "Recover them while you sleep."
- **Value Stack**: List Multi-channel + AI Smart Offers + Optimal Timing.
- **Risk Reversal**: "Only pay 5% of recovered sales."

### 3. Salla App Store Optimization
- Use keywords like: `استرداد عربات`, `سلة`, `زيادة مبيعات`, `واتساب`.
- Focus on "One-Click Installation".
