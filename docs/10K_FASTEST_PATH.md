## 🔢 MODEL ANALYSIS

### Model 1: Pure Revenue Share (30%)

**Math:**
- Average cart (luxury): $500
- WhatsApp recovery rate: 15%
- Our cut: 30%
- **Per recovered cart: $500 × 30% = $150**
- Per 100 abandoned carts: 15 recovered × $150 = **$2,250**

**To hit $10k:**
- Need: ~67 recovered carts
- At 15% recovery = ~445 abandoned carts
- Average store: 50-200 abandoned carts/month

| Store Size | Abandoned Carts/mo | Recovered | Revenue/mo |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Small | 50 | 7.5 | $1,125 |
| Medium | 200 | 30 | $4,500 |
| Large | 500 | 75 | $11,250 |

**⏱️ Time to $10k:** 
- 1 large store = instant (if they have volume)
- 3-4 medium stores = 1 month
- **NOT viable for 5 days** - need revenue to actually flow

**Verdict:** ❌ Too slow for 5-day goal (need to wait for carts + recovery)

---

### Model 2: Upfront + Revenue Share

**Structure:** $1,000 setup + 30% ongoing

**To hit $10k:**
- 10 clients × $1,000 = $10,000 upfront
- PLUS ongoing revenue

**Reality Check:**
- $1,000 is easy to justify for serious stores
- 10 sales in 5 days = 2 per day
- Needs strong outreach + demo capability

**⏱️ Time to $10k:** Possible in 5 days with aggressive outreach

**Verdict:** ⚠️ Possible but requires 10 separate sales

## 📊 ROI CALCULATOR (Use in Pitches)

**Formula for stores:**
```
Monthly Recovered Revenue = 
  (Abandoned Carts/month) × 15% × (Average Order Value)

Annual Recovered Revenue = Monthly × 12

ROI = (Annual Recovered - License Fee) / License Fee × 100%
```

**Example for $10k Lifetime Deal:**
- 500 abandoned carts/month × 15% = 75 recovered
- 75 × $500 AOV = $37,500/month recovered
- Our 30% cut = $11,250/month (if rev share)
- OR they pay $10k once = saves $125k+ over year
- **ROI: 1,250%+ in first year alone**
