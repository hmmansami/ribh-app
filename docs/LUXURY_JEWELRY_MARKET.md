## 4. The Math: RIBH Revenue Projections

### Model Assumptions
| Variable | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Monthly abandoned carts | 150 | 400 | 800 |
| Abandoned cart value | $400 | $400 | $400 |
| WhatsApp recovery rate | 12% | 18% | 25% |
| RIBH revenue share | 30% | 30% | 30% |

### Revenue Per Store Per Month

**Conservative (Small Store)**
- Abandoned carts: 150
- Recovered: 150 × 12% = 18 carts
- Revenue recovered: 18 × $400 = $7,200
- **RIBH take: $7,200 × 30% = $2,160/month**

**Moderate (Medium Store)**
- Abandoned carts: 400
- Recovered: 400 × 18% = 72 carts
- Revenue recovered: 72 × $400 = $28,800
- **RIBH take: $28,800 × 30% = $8,640/month**

**Optimistic (Large Store)**
- Abandoned carts: 800
- Recovered: 800 × 25% = 200 carts
- Revenue recovered: 200 × $400 = $80,000
- **RIBH take: $80,000 × 30% = $24,000/month**

### Stores Needed for Targets

| Target | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **$100k/month** | 47 stores | 12 stores | 5 stores |
| **$10k in 5 days** | 28 stores | 7 stores | 3 stores |
| **$1M/month** | 463 stores | 116 stores | 42 stores |

### Realistic Mixed Portfolio

Assume acquisition of:
- 30% small stores ($2,160/mo avg)
- 50% medium stores ($8,640/mo avg)
- 20% large stores ($24,000/mo avg)

**Weighted average: $8,568/month per store**

| Target | Stores Needed |
|--------|--------------|
| **$10k in 5 days** | **7-10 stores** |
| **$100k/month** | **12-20 stores** |
| **$1M/month** | **117-150 stores** |

## 5. Competition Analysis

### Salla Ecosystem (Saudi Arabia)

| App | Pricing | Features | Reviews |
|-----|---------|----------|---------|
| **Karzoun** | 1,669 SAR/year (~$445/yr, $37/mo) | WhatsApp notifications, abandoned cart, campaigns | 1,111 (5-star) |
| **WhatsApp + AI** | 119 SAR/month (~$32/mo) | Cart recovery, order status, AI | New |
| **Auto Wats** | Unknown | WhatsApp, abandoned cart | Medium |
| **Bevatel** | Unknown | WhatsApp, suspended baskets | Medium |

### Shopify Ecosystem (Global)

| Platform | Pricing | Model |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Klaviyo** | $20-500+/month | Flat fee by contacts |
| **Omnisend** | $16-59+/month | Flat fee by contacts |
| **Privy** | $30-80+/month | Flat fee |
| **Recart** | ~$29+/month | Flat fee |
| **CartStack** | $29-99/month | Flat fee |

### The Gap (RIBH Opportunity) 🎯

**Current solutions:**
- Flat monthly fee ($30-50/month typical)
- No risk for store = no skin in the game
- Generic templates, not jewelry-specific
- Focus on email, WhatsApp as afterthought

**RIBH differentiators:**
1. **Pay-per-performance** - Store only pays when sales recovered
2. **30% of recovered revenue** - Aligned incentives
3. **WhatsApp-first** - 2-4x better recovery than email
4. **Jewelry-specific** - Language, timing, psychology tuned for luxury
5. **Arabic-native** - Perfect for Saudi market
6. **Zero upfront cost** - No risk to try

**Price comparison for typical store:**
- Karzoun: $445/year = $37/month (fixed)
- RIBH: $2,160-8,640/month (but ONLY on recovered sales)

**Stores win when:**
- Recovery is successful → they're happy to share 30%
- Recovery fails → they pay nothing (unlike competitors)
