# Alex Hormozi's Downsell Strategy
## From $100M Money Models & $100M Offers

## 1. WHAT is a Downsell (Hormozi's Definition)

> "Downselling tweaks the original offer to find the highest value solution for the customer's budget."
> — Alex Hormozi, $100M Money Models

A downsell is **NOT**:
- A discount on the same product
- Begging for the sale
- Negotiating your price down
- An admission of failure

A downsell **IS**:
- A different offer at a different price point
- A pivot when someone says "no" to your main offer
- Finding a "match" by making trades (give something, get something)
- Converting a potential lost sale into a profitable "yes"

**Key Principle:** Never negotiate the same product for less. Always change what they get when you change the price.

---

## 2. WHEN to Offer a Downsell

### Only After a Decline
The downsell happens **AFTER** they say "no" to your main offer. Never before. Never preemptively.

### What Kind of Decline?

**Downsell-Appropriate Declines:**
- "It's too expensive" (PRICE objection)
- "I can't afford it right now" (MONEY circumstance)
- "Too much upfront" (CASH FLOW issue)
- "I need to think about the price" (PRICE hesitation)

**NOT Downsell-Appropriate Declines:**
- "I'm not interested" (NO FIT)
- "I don't think this will work for me" (BELIEF issue)
- "I don't have time" (TIME objection - different handling)
- "I need to talk to my spouse" (DECISION objection - different handling)

### Hormozi's Objection Categories

According to Hormozi, objections fall into three blame categories:

| Category | Examples | Downsell? |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Circumstances** | Money, Time, Fit | ✅ Money = Yes |
| **Others** | Spouse, Partner, Kids | ❌ Handle differently |
| **Self** | Past failures, fear | ❌ Handle differently |

**Money objections = Downsell candidates**
**Everything else = Different handling needed**

## 3. HOW to Present a Downsell

### The Golden Rules

1. **Never insult** - Don't imply they can't afford the main offer
2. **Maintain value perception** - The downsell should feel like a different product, not a "lesser" one
3. **Make trades** - If you give something (lower price), you get something (fewer features, different terms)
4. **Present as an alternative**, not as "settling"

### The Three Downsell Types (Hormozi)

#### A. Payment Plan Downsells
**What:** Break down the total cost into smaller, manageable installments.

**When to use:** They want the full offer but can't pay all upfront.

**How to frame it:**
> "I hear you. The full investment upfront isn't a fit right now. What if we structure it differently - [X amount] now, and [X amount] over the next [Y weeks/months]?"

**Key:** Align payments with their cash flow (paychecks, revenue cycles).

**Example:**
- Original: 2,000 SAR upfront
- Downsell: 500 SAR now + 500 SAR/week for 3 weeks

#### B. Feature Downsells
**What:** Lower the price by removing specific features, reducing quantity, or offering a lower-tier version.

**When to use:** They want results but don't need everything you offer.

**How to frame it:**
> "Got it. What if we focused just on [core outcome]? We'd remove [X, Y, Z features] and bring the investment down to [new price]. You'd still get [main benefit]."

**Key:** Let them choose what to cut. Sometimes they "re-upsell" themselves when they see what they'd lose.

**Example:**
- Original: Full program with 1-on-1 support, community, templates
- Downsell: Self-paced program with templates only (no 1-on-1)

#### C. Trial with Penalty
**What:** Offer a free/low-cost trial, but with conditions. They only pay a fee if they fail to meet the terms.

**When to use:** They're hesitant to commit without seeing results first.

**How to frame it:**
> "What if you try it for [X period] at no risk? The only way you pay [penalty fee] is if you don't [complete the required actions]. If you do the work and it doesn't deliver, you owe nothing."

**Key:** Incentivizes engagement AND conversion.

## 4. WHO to Offer Downsells To

### 🎯 Ideal Downsell Candidates

| Signal | What They Say | Why It's Good |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Price objection** | "It's a lot of money" | They want it, just stuck on price |
| **Budget constraint** | "I don't have that right now" | Temporary obstacle, not permanent |
| **Cash flow issue** | "Can't do that much upfront" | Willing, just needs flexibility |
| **Comparing options** | "That's more than others charge" | Engaged, just needs value clarity |

### ❌ NOT Downsell Candidates

| Signal | What They Say | What to Do Instead |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **No interest** | "I'm not interested" | Walk away, nurture long-term |
| **Wrong fit** | "This isn't for me" | Qualify better next time |
| **No belief** | "I don't think it works" | Handle belief objection (testimonials, proof) |
| **Partner objection** | "I need to ask my spouse" | Get them on the call, address together |

## 6. How to Diagnose PRICE vs INTEREST

This is the critical skill. Wrong diagnosis = wasted downsell.

### Diagnostic Questions

After they decline, ask:

> **"Just so I understand - is it the investment itself, or is there something about the program that doesn't feel right for you?"**

This forces clarity:
- **"It's the money"** → Downsell candidate ✅
- **"I'm not sure it's for me"** → Not a downsell, handle fit/belief ❌

### Other Diagnostic Approaches

**The "If Money Weren't an Issue" Test:**
> "If money weren't a factor at all, is this something you'd want to do?"

- **YES** → Price objection, downsell works ✅
- **NO/HESITATION** → Something else is the issue ❌

**The "What Would Make This Work" Test:**
> "What would need to be different for this to be a no-brainer for you?"

Listen for:
- Price/payment mentioned → Downsell ✅
- Other concerns → Handle those first ❌

**The Specificity Test:**
> "When you say it's too much, do you mean the total amount, or the amount right now?"

- **Total amount** → Feature downsell
- **Right now** → Payment plan downsell

## 7. Downsell Scripts for RIBH

### After Price Objection (Payment Plan)

**Arabic-friendly version:**
> "أفهمك تماماً. المبلغ الكامل مرة واحدة ممكن يكون صعب. خلني أسألك - لو قسّمناها على [X فترة]، هل كذا يكون أسهل؟"

**English:**
> "I totally get it. The full amount upfront can be a stretch. Let me ask - if we split it over [X period], would that work better for you?"

### After Price Objection (Feature Downsell)

**Arabic-friendly version:**
> "فهمت. طيب خلني أقترح شي - عندنا نسخة مركّزة على [الفائدة الأساسية] بس، بدون [الإضافات]. هذي بـ [السعر الجديد]. تحصل على [النتيجة الرئيسية] بميزانية أقل."

**English:**
> "Got it. Let me suggest something - we have a focused version that covers [core benefit] only, without [extras]. That's [new price]. You'd still get [main outcome] at a lower investment."

### Walking Away (If Still No)

> "No problem at all. The door's always open if things change. I'll check in with you in [timeframe] - but only if that's helpful?"

## 8. Common Downsell Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Offering downsell before they decline main offer**
   - Makes you look desperate
   - Anchors them at lower price

2. **Discounting the same product**
   - Destroys value perception
   - Teaches them to negotiate

3. **Making the downsell feel "lesser"**
   - "Well, there's a cheaper option..."
   - "If you can't afford the real one..."

4. **Downselling to someone not interested**
   - Wastes time
   - Looks pushy

5. **Not having a downsell ready**
   - Scrambling in the moment
   - Missing the sale

### ✅ Do This Instead

1. Wait for clear decline
2. Diagnose the reason
3. Offer a **different** product at different price
4. Frame as "alternative" not "inferior"
5. Have 2-3 downsell options pre-planned

---

## 9. Downsell Math (Why It Matters)

### Without Downsell:
- 100 prospects
- 30% close at 2,000 SAR = 60,000 SAR
- 70 walk away = 0 SAR
- **Total: 60,000 SAR**

### With Downsell:
- 100 prospects
- 30% close at 2,000 SAR = 60,000 SAR
- 70 decline → 50% have price objection (35 people)
- 30% of price objectors take downsell at 800 SAR = 8,400 SAR
- **Total: 68,400 SAR (+14% revenue)**

The downsell captures money that would have walked out the door.

## 10. Key Hormozi Quotes on Downselling

> "When a customer says 'no' to an offer, it doesn't mean they're not interested in anything. It means the current offer isn't the right fit."

> "Downsells are designed to pivot, offering alternative solutions that align better with the customer's budget or specific needs."

> "If you give something (like a lower price), you get something in return (like fewer features or a different payment structure). This maintains the value perception and avoids simple discounting."

> "The goal is to find a 'match' by making trades."

---

## Summary

| Element | Hormozi's Approach |
|---------|-------------------|
| **What** | Different offer at different price (not a discount) |
| **When** | ONLY after decline, ONLY for price objections |
| **How** | Payment plans, feature cuts, trials with conditions |
| **Who** | Price-sensitive people who WANT the outcome |
| **Sequence** | Core Offer → Decline → Diagnose → Downsell → Close or Walk |

**The key insight:** Downsells are for people who want your solution but can't meet your terms. They are NOT for people who don't want your solution at any price.
