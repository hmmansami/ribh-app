# HORMOZI OFFER SEQUENCING - Master Guide

> Based on Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers, $100M Leads, and $100M Money Models frameworks

---

## 🎯 THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**"A Money Model is a deliberate sequence of offers designed to maximize how much, how fast, and how often customers pay you."**

The goal: Generate enough profit from a customer within the **first 30 days** to cover acquisition costs and fund acquiring more customers. This creates a self-sustaining growth engine.

---

## 📊 THE FOUR OFFER TYPES

### 1️⃣ ATTRACTION OFFERS (Stage I: Get Cash)
**Purpose:** Turn strangers into customers

**When to use:** First contact with cold/warm leads

**Types:**
- **Giveaways** - "Win Your Money Back" challenges, contests
- **Decoy Offers** - Low-cost entry ($1-$29) that leads to premium
- **Buy X Get Y Free** - Reframe pricing for perceived value
- **Pay Less Now, Pay More Later** - Discounts for early commitment
- **Free Trials** - Full access, limited time
- **Lead Magnets** - Valuable free content solving narrow problem

**Pricing:** Free to Low-ticket ($0-$99)

---

### 2️⃣ UPSELL OFFERS (Stage II: Get More Cash)
**Purpose:** Maximize immediate customer value after initial purchase

**When to use:** IMMEDIATELY after purchase (while in "hyper buying cycle")

**Types:**
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Classic Upsell** | Solution to obvious next problem | Insurance with rental car |
| **Menu Upsell** | Good/Better/Best options | Tier packages |
| **Anchor Upsell** | Show premium first, then main offer | $20k system → $12k feels like deal |
| **Rollover Upsell** | Credit past purchases toward bigger sale | "$750 maintenance → counts toward new system" |

**Key Rule:** Offer value at least **4x the rollover credit** to maintain profitability

---

### 3️⃣ DOWNSELL OFFERS (Stage II: Get More Cash)
**Purpose:** Convert "No" into profitable "Yes"

**When to use:** Immediately when customer declines main offer

**Types:**
- **Payment Plan Downsells** - Break cost into installments
- **Trial With Penalty** - Free trial, fee only if they fail conditions
- **Feature Downsells** - Remove features to lower price
- **Quantity Downsells** - Smaller package/shorter term

**Psychology:** "If you give something (lower price), get something in return (fewer features)"

---

### 4️⃣ CONTINUITY OFFERS (Stage III: Get The Most Cash)
**Purpose:** Maximize lifetime value through recurring revenue

**When to use:** After initial cash capture (30+ days), during onboarding, or at service milestones

**Types:**
- **Continuity Bonus** - High-value one-time bonus for recurring signup
- **Continuity Discount** - "Buy 12 months, get 3 months free"
- **Waived Fee Offer** - Waive setup fee for longer commitment

**Pro Tip:** Bill weekly/bi-weekly instead of monthly = 8.3% more annual revenue (13 four-week cycles vs 12 months)

## 🤖 AI IMPLEMENTATION DECISION TREE

Use this logic for automated offer selection:

```python
def select_offer(customer):
    
    # NEW VISITOR (never purchased)
    if customer.purchase_count == 0:
        if customer.visited_before:
            return ATTRACTION_OFFER_WITH_URGENCY
        else:
            return LEAD_MAGNET → ATTRACTION_OFFER
    
    # JUST PURCHASED (within session)
    if customer.just_purchased:
        return UPSELL_OFFER  # Immediate, don't wait
    
    # DECLINED OFFER (within session)
    if customer.just_declined:
        return DOWNSELL_OFFER  # Immediate alternative
    
    # RECENT CUSTOMER (< 30 days)
    if customer.days_since_purchase < 30:
        if not customer.has_continuity:
            return CONTINUITY_OFFER
        else:
            return RELATED_UPSELL
    
    # ACTIVE CUSTOMER (30-90 days)
    if 30 <= customer.days_since_purchase < 90:
        if customer.engagement_declining:
            return RETENTION_OFFER
        else:
            return UPGRADE_OFFER

            return WIN_BACK_DISCOUNT

        return WIN_BACK_CAMPAIGN

        return VIP_UPGRADE or REFERRAL_PROGRAM
```

## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

### 1. The Problem-Solution Cycle
> "Every offer that solves a problem reveals a new one."

Your upsells should solve the problems your main offer creates.

### 2. The 4x Rule for Rollovers
> "The new offer should be at least 4x the value of the rollover credit."

### 3. Timing is Everything
> "Present the upsell immediately after the free trial when interest is highest."
> "Upsell within first 30-60 days of transaction for best results."

### 4. Simple Scales
> "Simple models scale effectively while fancy ones often fail."

Perfect ONE offer type before adding the next.

### 5. Bill Smarter
- Weekly billing = 8.3% more annual revenue
- Add 3% processing fee = pure profit
- Request second payment method = reduce churn

### 6. The Rule of 100
- 100 outreaches per day, OR
- 100 minutes of content per day, OR
- $100 on ads per day

### 7. Never Discount - Add Bonuses Instead
> "Never discount the offer when trying to close. It teaches people your prices are negotiable. Instead, use bonuses."

This removes cash constraints and enables unlimited scaling.
