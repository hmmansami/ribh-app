# Alex Hormozi: Bundle & Cross-Sell Strategy

> "Make offers so good people feel stupid saying no."

## 🎯 The Value Equation

The foundation of ALL Hormozi offers. Memorize this:

```
           Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood
Value = ─────────────────────────────────────────
              Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice
```

### Breaking It Down:

| Variable | Increase Value By... |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Dream Outcome** ↑ | Show the TRANSFORMATION, not features. "Confident body in the mirror" > "lose weight" |
| **Perceived Likelihood** ↑ | Testimonials, case studies, guarantees, social proof |
| **Time Delay** ↓ | Faster results = more valuable. "Results in 30 days" beats "6 months" |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** ↓ | Make it EASY. Done-for-you > done-with-you > DIY |

**The Math:** To increase value, you must:
- MAXIMIZE numerator (Dream Outcome × Likelihood)
- MINIMIZE denominator (Time × Effort)

## 📦 Cross-Sell vs Bundle vs Upsell

### Definitions

| Type | What It Is | When | Example |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| **Bundle** | Multiple items packaged TOGETHER at one price | BEFORE/DURING purchase | "Get coaching + templates + community for $997" |
| **Upsell** | Upgraded/premium version of what they're buying | DURING purchase | "Upgrade to VIP for personal calls" |
| **Cross-Sell** | Complementary product/service | AFTER initial purchase | "You bought X, you'll also need Y" |
| **Downsell** | Cheaper alternative when they say no | AFTER rejection | "Can't afford $997? Here's $297 version" |

### Key Insight from Hormozi:

> "Upsells flop when you offer something they don't want, it's unrelated, or it's poorly timed."

**The Rule:** Cross-sells and upsells should offer:
- **More of what they got** (quantity)
- **Better versions** (quality)  
- **Complementary stuff** (related items)

## 🎰 The Value Stack Technique

This is Hormozi's secret weapon for making offers feel like no-brainers.

### The Sandwich Analogy
> "Think of it like building a delicious sandwich. The bread is your main offer, but the toppings—like bonuses and guarantees—make it truly satisfying."

### How To Stack Value:

**Step 1: Start with Core Offer**
- The main transformation you deliver
- Example: "12-week fitness program"

**Step 2: Add Bonuses That Remove Objections**
Each bonus should address a reason someone might NOT buy:

| Objection | Bonus Solution |
|-----------|---------------|
| "I don't know what to eat" | Meal plan included |
| "I can't stay motivated" | Daily check-in texts |
| "I'll forget the exercises" | Video library access |
| "What if I fail?" | Money-back guarantee |

**Step 3: Stack Until Value = 10x Price**
The total perceived value should be 5-10x the actual price.

### Real Example: Fitness Coaching Stack

```
CORE OFFER: 12-Week Transformation Program
├── Bonus 1: Custom Meal Plans ($297 value)
├── Bonus 2: Exercise Video Library ($197 value)  
├── Bonus 3: Daily Accountability Texts ($497 value)
├── Bonus 4: Weekly Strategy Calls ($997 value)
├── Bonus 5: Supplement Guide ($97 value)
└── Bonus 6: Results Guarantee (PRICELESS)

Total Stacked Value: $2,085+
Your Price: $497
Perceived Deal: 4x value
```

## ⏰ WHEN To Offer Bundles

### Hormozi's Timing Framework:

**1. ATTRACTION OFFERS (Before Purchase)**
- Get them in the door
- Low-cost or free entry points
- Examples:
  - $29 service call instead of $99
  - Free inspection
  - Giveaway contests

**2. CORE BUNDLES (During Purchase)**
- Your main Grand Slam Offer
- Maximum value stack
- Present premium option FIRST (anchor high)

**3. UPSELLS (Immediately After Yes)**
> "Hormozi positions upsells immediately after you have consumed the first bit of value."

- Right after they buy
- "You can't have X without Y"
- Solve the NEW problem created by the first purchase

**The Fur Coat Story (from Hormozi):**
```
Customer buys coat → Shop offers FREE earmuffs 
Shop offers coat storage → Customer says yes
Shop: "Now you need earmuff storage too" ($$$)
```
Genius: They flipped "no" into "yes" by creating a new need.

**4. DOWNSELLS (After Rejection)**
- Payment plans
- Stripped-down versions
- Trial with penalty

**5. CONTINUITY (After Purchase)**
- Recurring revenue plays
- Membership/subscription
- Annual maintenance plans

## 🏆 The "Grand Slam Offer" Formula

### 9 Components:

1. **Right Market** (Starving Crowd)
   - Desperate need
   - Can afford solution
   - Easy to reach

2. **Value-Based Pricing**
   - Charge based on VALUE, not time/cost
   - "Charging what it's worth"

3. **Feature Bundling**
   - Combine elements for perceived value
   - Repackage existing services new ways

4. **Value Proposition**
   - Clear outcome promised
   - Problems it solves
   - Solutions provided

5. **Scalable Delivery**
   - Can you fulfill at volume?
   - One-to-many > one-to-one

6. **Bonuses (Cross-Promotions)**
   - Your products + other people's products
   - The "11 Bullets" technique

7. **Guarantees**
   - Unconditional (full refund, no questions)
   - Conditional (specific outcome or money back)
   - STACK guarantees to eliminate ALL risk

8. **Scarcity & Urgency**
   - Limited units OR limited time
   - Real constraints, not fake

9. **Naming (M-A-G-I-C Formula)**
   - Make it obvious who it's for
   - "People like me buy things like that"
