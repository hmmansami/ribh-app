# Ribh One-Click Structure (for Kimi)

## Goal
Design a **feel-first, non-functional** UI/UX concept for Ribh's one-click outcome experience.
Do NOT wire backend yet. We only want to feel trust, speed, and instant outcome.

## Product truth (backend intent)
Ribh backend is designed as a one-click activation engine with these states:
1. Salla connected
2. WhatsApp connected
3. Sequences deployed
4. AI enabled
5. Fully active

## Activation endpoints (feature branch reference)
- `GET /api/activation/status`
- `POST /api/activation/toggle`
- `POST /api/activation/activate`
- `GET /api/activation/ai-status`
- `POST /api/activation/preview-offer`

## UX narrative we need to communicate
- "Everything is preloaded"
- "One click starts revenue recovery"
- "You can see what happens instantly"
- "You stay in control (toggle/pause), no complexity"

## Required sections (non-functional UI only)
1. Hero with one dominant CTA
2. Trust strip (safe, no card, ready in seconds)
3. Outcome preview cards (recovered carts, revenue, AI messages)
4. Activation timeline (what happens after click)
5. Simple control card (pause/resume concept)

## Audience
Non-technical Saudi store owners.
Arabic-first, RTL-first, mobile-first.

## Tone
Calm confidence, premium clarity, no technical jargon.

## Copy style
- Short Arabic lines
- Action-oriented verbs
- Show results before explaining mechanics
