# RIBH EXECUTION PLAN - 100K IN 2 WEEKS

## THE RESEARCH (What Makes the Most Money)

### Top Shopify Apps - Revenue & Pricing Models

| App | Annual Revenue | Customers | Avg Revenue/Customer | Model |
|-----|---------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Klaviyo** | $1.2B+ | 183,000+ | $5,400/yr ($450/mo) | Profile-based subscription |
| **Omnisend** | ~$100M+ | 70,000+ | ~$1,400/yr | Contact-tier subscription |
| **TxtCart** | Growing fast | Thousands | $29-$499/mo + commission | Hybrid subscription + commission |
| **Attentive** | $500M+ | Enterprise | $8,000+/yr minimum | Platform fee + per-message |
| **Postscript** | ~$100M+ | Thousands | $0.01/msg + plans | Usage-based + subscription |

### What Makes Klaviyo Worth $1.2B/year (THE BLUEPRINT)

1. **Predictive Analytics** - Know what customers will do BEFORE they do it
   - Historic & predicted CLV
   - Churn risk percentage
   - Next order date prediction
   - Average time between orders

2. **RFM Segmentation** - Automatic customer scoring (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, etc.)

3. **Flow Triggers** - Event-based automation (welcome, browse abandon, cart abandon, post-purchase, winback, replenishment)

4. **Multi-channel** - Email + SMS + Push in one platform

5. **Shopify-native** - Deep integration, one-click install

### What Makes TxtCart a "Money Printer" (THE MODEL TO COPY)

- **2-way AI conversations** via SMS - not just blast messages
- **Performance-based pricing** - pay commission only on recovered revenue
- **Hybrid model**: $29-499/mo base + 2.5-15% of recovered revenue
- **10x ROI guarantee** for qualifying accounts
- Merchants report $8,500+ additional revenue in 45 days

### Salla Competition (WIDE OPEN)

| Competitor | Price | What They Do | Weakness |
|-----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **LetsBot** | 119 SAR/mo ($32) | WhatsApp cart recovery | No AI personalization, basic templates |
| **SmartWats** | Unknown | WhatsApp bot, cart reminders | No multi-channel, no analytics |
| **BusinessChat** | Unknown | WhatsApp notifications | Generic, not Salla-native |
| **Zaboon** | Unknown | Email marketing only | Email only, no WhatsApp/SMS |

**CRITICAL INSIGHT: The Salla SMS category literally shows "No apps available." The WhatsApp apps are basic. NONE offer AI personalization, multi-channel, predictive analytics, or RFM. This is a blue ocean.**

## THE STRATEGY

### First Principles Breakdown

```
100K in 2 weeks = More Buyers x Worth More

More Buyers:
  1000 stores @ $100 each
  200 stores @ $500 each
  100 stores @ $1000 each

More Buyers = Cold Outreach (1-1 to people we don't know)
  Tool: Scrape all Salla stores → WhatsApp/Email them

Worth More = Price x Buy More Times
  Price = Value-based (10x perceived value gap)
  Buy More = Subscription + Upsells + Continuity
```

#### WHY FREE + 10% COMMISSION WINS:

1. **Removes ALL friction** - "You pay nothing. We only make money when YOU make money."
2. **Impossible to say no** - Hormozi's "Grand Slam Offer" test: would someone feel stupid saying no? YES.
3. **Creates urgency** - "100 spots, then it's SAR 499/mo forever"
4. **Builds case studies FAST** - 100 stores = 100 success stories
5. **Word of mouth** - Free tool that makes money? People TALK about it.
6. **Revenue math still works**:
   - 100 stores × avg SAR 10,000 recovered/mo × 10% = SAR 100,000/mo ($26,700)
   - 200 stores × avg SAR 5,000 recovered/mo × 10% = SAR 100,000/mo
   - Even conservative: 100 stores × SAR 3,000 × 10% = SAR 30,000/mo ($8,000)

#### AFTER 100 FOUNDING MEMBERS → Scale Pricing:

| Tier | Monthly Base | Commission | Target |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Starter** | SAR 199 ($53) | 10% | <50 carts/month |
| **Growth** | SAR 499 ($133) | 5% | 50-200 carts/month |
| **Pro** | SAR 999 ($266) | 3% | 200+ carts/month |

سؤال سريع: تعرف إن 70% من زوارك يتركون سلاتهم بدون ما يشترون؟

يعني لو مبيعاتك الشهرية [X] ريال، فيه تقريبا [X×0.7] ريال ضايعة كل شهر 😱

English:
Hey [Store Owner]! 👋

I saw your store [Store Name] - love your products!

Quick question: Did you know 70% of your visitors leave without buying?

That means if you make [X] SAR/month, you're losing about [X×0.7] SAR every month 😱
