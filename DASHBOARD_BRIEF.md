# Dashboard Design Brief

## Steve Jobs Principles
1. **Simplicity** - Remove everything unnecessary
2. **Focus** - One metric that matters: MONEY RECOVERED
3. **Say no** - No feature bloat, no clutter
4. **How it works > looks** - Every pixel serves a purpose
5. **Customer experience first** - Merchant sees money, feels dopamine

## The ONE Thing Dashboard Must Do
**Show the merchant they're making money while they sleep**

## Core Elements (Max 3)
1. 💰 **Money Recovered** - Big, beautiful, animated counter
2. 📊 **Live Activity Feed** - Watch AI working in real-time
3. 🟢 **Status** - WhatsApp connected, system healthy

## Inspiration Sources
- Stripe Dashboard (clean, financial focus)
- Linear (minimal, fast, beautiful)
- Vercel (dark mode, developer-friendly)
- Arabic luxury brands (premium feel)

## Constraints
- Dark mode primary
- Arabic RTL
- Mobile-first (merchants check on phone)
- Load < 2 seconds
- Zero learning curve

## Emotional Goal
Merchant opens dashboard → sees money → smiles → trusts RIBH
